Incompatibilites:

This game was programmed with Chrome web browser in mind
that being said, this log shows inconsistancies among
other web browsers, i will fix what I can.

IE:
The audio does not work,
the positioning of the back button is slightly off.

Firefox:
-back button is a bit off...

Opera and Chrome:
Absolutely no issues.

Safari:
The audio does not work and the back button is ever
so slightly too far to the right.
Also, the "Back to Menu" button doesn't work in this
browser only.

Current Objectives:

 
-2When matches are made, for them to remain face up, otherwise to return face down.
- 1Add a win condition and message as well as a lose condition and message for the end game, also refer to the back button to restart
the game in the message to clarify that you can do that as the player.
-the timer needs to reset (and not speed up) when the player goes back and starts a new game.
- FINISH STYLING IT UP WITH SOME LAST MINUTE CSS!! :D
THIS IS FOR EXTRA SUPPORT SO EVERYONE CAN DISPLAY THE TEXT PROPERLY. THIS ALSO GOES FOR INSERTING ADDITIONAL
AUDIO FORMATS AND WHATNOT (GRAPHIC FORMATS FOR SAFARI AS WELL!)'

-make the credits and the how to screen text neat and tidy.
-change the main menu background to make it cooler and more retro!
- fix the javascript!!
-put an example in the hot to play in the space there.
-use the graphics from the main menu and use those in the game itself so it looks consistant, then update the credits to be
accurate!
